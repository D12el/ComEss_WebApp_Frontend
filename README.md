🌐 Deployment

Since this project uses Express, it is not suitable for GitHub Pages (which only hosts static files).
You can deploy to platforms that support Node.js such as:

Render

Railway

Heroku

Vercel
 (with Node server config)

🔧 Development Notes

Place your frontend build/static files in the public/ folder (e.g., index.html, CSS, JS).

Update PORT in server.js if you need a different port.

Ensure firewall rules or cloud provider allow external access if deploying online.
